## Unknown fallback
Unknown request fallback handler

## Description 
Mycroft doesn't know how to do and answer everything (yet).  This fallback is how Mycroft lets
you know that it just can't help with what you said.

But wait, there is still hope!  Mycroft is working to get smarter with help from friends.  For who have
selected to [Opt In to the Open Dataset](https://home.mycroft.ai/#/setting/basic#opendataset), these missed phrases will be aggregated and analyzed to help identify
what the world _wants_ their voice assistant to do that it can't.  So if millions of people start asking for guava growing tips, we'll promote this as an idea to be handled as a default skill.
We also are beginning mechanisms which can help you find existing skills that can be added to your device.

## Examples 
* "How do I make my guava blue?"
* "I need a pizza"
* "Show me the money"
